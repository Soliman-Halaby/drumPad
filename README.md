This drumpad is easy to use. First, turn on the drumpad by checking the checkbox.                                             
Then you can click with your mouse or with a key on the boxes, you will even have the name of the sound effects.               
Each theme has different sounds.                                                                                               
A little surprise is also prepared for you. It is an oscillator, but still pay attention to your ears!     
You'll discover many features but also hidden features, when you play with the number of Hertz of the oscillator for example!             

The sounds of the first theme come from a bookstore.                                                                          
The sounds of the second theme come from Codepen : https://codepen.io/no_stack_dub_sack/pen/woQzNW
